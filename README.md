### For our full-stack project which consolidates all the technical skills that we have learnt in the last four weeks at La Fosse, we have created an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) called VivaLingo - an app that allows schoolchildren to learn French.

The aim of the app is to provide fun and engaging way of learning a non-STEM subject. The app allows for the translating of basic concepts. 

## Stakeholder & Solutions Analysis

- [ ] As a student, I want a fun, simple language learning app, so that learning a language can be an engaging, repeatable, and memory-friendly experience, without being bombarded with overwhelming amounts of content. 
- [ ] As a teacher, I want a simple language learning app for my students to use, so that they can retain key phrases through repetition with increasing challenges, while not getting bored. This app should provide a respite from facing lots of content in non-STEM subjects like languages or geography.
- [ ] As a product owner, I want a simple, fun language learning app for teenagers, so that an alternative is available when compared to other apps that contain an overwhelming amount of content and visuals.

A visualisation of the importance of each stakeholder can be viewed in this stakeholder analysis diagram. The teacher and student remain the most fundamentally importance in utilising the app accordingly.
